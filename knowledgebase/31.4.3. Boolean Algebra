The truth table for a full adder is shown below. There are eight rows as opposed to the fo ur 
rows of the half adder due to the additional third input, C in.  
  
A  B  Cin  Cout   Sum  
0  0  0  0  0  
0  0  1  0  1  
0  1  0  0  1  
0  1  1  1  0  
1  0  0  0  1  
1  0  1  1  0  
1  1  0  1  0  
1  1  1  1  1  
  
Because the full adder has a carry input, the circuits can be chained together to form 
what’s known as a ripple adder . At each stage, B and C in can be connected to the previous 
 adder’s S and C out, and a new input can be attached to A.
