 
This is how a constructor is used to create a new object called ​‘myBook​ ’ from the ​‘Book​ ’ 
class: 
 
myBook = new Book(‘Great Expectations’, ‘Charles Dickens’,’False’,  
False’) 
 
When a book is reserved, the following code would be used to call the setter function:  
 
myBook.set_reserved()  
 
Another property of object-oriented programming is ​inheritance ​. 
When a class inherits from another, the ​subclass ​will ​possess 
all of the methods and attributes ​ ​of the​ superclass ​ and​ can also 
have its own additional properties ​.  This feature of OOP allows 
programmers to ​effectively reuse certain components and 
properties while making some changes ​. 
 
Inheritance would be expressed as: 
 
class Biography inherits Book  
 
Polymorphism ​is a property of OOP that means ​objects can 
behave differently depending on their class ​. There are two 
categories of polymorphism: overriding and overloading. 
Overriding ​is​ redefining a method ​ within a subclass and altering the code so that it 
functions differently ​and ​produces a different output ​. 
Overloading ​is ​passing in different parameters into a method ​.  
 
Advantages 
- OOP allows for a ​high level of reusability ​, which makes it useful for projects where 
there are multiple, similar components. 
- Classes can also be ​used across multiple projects ​. 
-Encapsulation ​ makes the ​code more reliable ​by ​protecting attribute ​s from being 
directly accessed.  
- OOP requires ​advance planning ​ and a ​thorough design ​ can produce a 
higher-quality piece of software with ​fewer vulnerabilities ​.  
- The ​modular structure ​ used in OOP ​makes it easy to maintain and update ​. 
- Once classes have been created and tested, they can be reused as a ​ black box 
which ​saves time and effort​. 
 
Disadvantages 
- This is a different style of programming and so ​ requires an alternative style of 
thinking ​.  
- OOP is​ not suited to all types of problems ​ and can sometimes produce a ​ longer, 
more inefficient program ​. 
- Generally ​unsuitable for smaller problems ​.
