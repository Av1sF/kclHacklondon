The candidate provides a limited
discussion which is narrow in focus.
Judgements if made are weak and
unsubstantiated.

in an unstructured way. The information is

No attempt to answer the question or
response is not worthy of credit.Not all of the process will be
paralleliseable. X processors does not
mean it will run in 1/xth of the time of
one processor.
Examiner’s Comment:
It was clear that many candidates had not
covered the concept of concurrency and
how it allows different processes to occur
at the same time. Strong candidates
appreciated that this could be simulated on
a single core with time slicing or
implemented within a parallel architecture.
Many candidates lost sight of the fact that
answers needed to be related to computer
science rather than a restaurant chain and
could not explain the underlying computer
science that would allow a solution to be
delivered.
