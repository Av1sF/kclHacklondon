manually work through ​ the code. A ​trace table​ is used to note down the ​logical flow  
through the program alongside when and which variables are updated. If an unexpected  
result is produced, the cause of this can be traced and fixed. The downside to dry-runs is  
that they cannot pick up on ​run-time​/​execution errors ​.
