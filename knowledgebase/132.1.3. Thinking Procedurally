● When constructing the final solution, thinking about the ​order in which operations 
are performed ​ is important. 
● Programs may require certain inputs to be entered in a particular order by the user 
before processing can occur.  
● Inputs need to be validated, and this must occur before this data is used. 
● In some cases, it may be possible for several subroutines to be executed 
simultaneously depending on the data and inputs the subroutine requires.   
● Programmers should decide on the ​order in which subroutines are executed ​, and 
how they interact with each other ​, based on their role in solving the problem. 
● Programs should also be built so operations cannot be carried out in an order that 
will raise an error or does not make logical sense.
