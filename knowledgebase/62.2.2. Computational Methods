 
Pipelining 
●Process in which modules are divided into individual tasks, with ​different tasks 
being developed in parallel  
●Enables faster project delivery 
●Output of one process typically becomes the input of another ​, resembling a 
production line  
●Commonly used in ​RISC processors ​: different sections of the 
Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle ​ are performed simultaneously  
 
Visualisation 
● Data can be ​ presented in a way that is easier for us to understand ​using graphs, 
trees, charts etc.  
● Makes it possible to ​identify trends that were not otherwise obvious
