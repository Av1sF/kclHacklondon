Examiner's Comments
There were quite a few very muddled
answers to this question, those that were
not muddled, were just plain wrong. A large
proportion of candidates either were
swapping for a bubble sort or using pivots;
neither of which were what was required.
ii
1 mark per correct row after row 1 in
sequence to max 44 Method must be demonstrated somehow -
circles, underlining, description e.g. “insert
12” etc
Must be an insertion sort
Do not allow swap(ped) or pivots
Examiner's Comments
Those who knew what an insertion sort
was got this correct, a fair percentage used
quick sorts or bubble sorts and as such did
not receive any marks.
