Level 1 Cache   Very fast memory cell, however it also has  
a small amount of capacity. (2-64KB)  
Level 2 Cache   Relatively fast memory cell, with medium  
sized capacity. (256KB-2MB)  
Level 3 Cache   Much larger and slower memory cell.   
 
 
Pipelining 
A-Level only 
●Pipelining: The process of completing the fetch, decode, and execute cycles of  
three separate instructions ​ ​simultaneously  
●Data is held in a ​buffer​ in close proximity to the CPU until it’s required 
● Pipelining is aimed to reduce the amount of the CPU which is kept ​idle ​.  
 
 
Computer Architecture  
Von Neumann Architecture: 
● Von Neumann includes a single ​control unit ​, ​ALU​, ​registers​ and ​memory units 
●Shared memory ​and ​data​ ​bus​ used for both data and instructions.  
 
Harvard Architecture:  
● Physically separate memories for instructions and data  
● More commonly used with embedded processors 
 Advantages of Von Neumann  
Architecture   Advantages of Harvard Architecture   
Cheaper to develop ​ since the control unit is  
easier to design.   Quicker​ since data and instructions can be  
fetched in parallel.   
Programs can be ​optimised in size ​.  Both ​memories can be different sizes ​,  
 
Contemporary Processing  
● The combination of ​Harvard and Von Neumann architecture   
● Uses Von Neumann when working with the data and instructions in main memory 
● Uses Harvard when working with cache. 
● There is an ​instruction cache ​ and ​data cache.
