expected result and the actual result of the test. There are three special types of data that  
programmers consider when testing: 
 
● Normal 
○ Data within the range of the data type considered as valid. 
● Boundary  
○ Data that falls at either of the ends of the valid data range. 
● Erroneous 
○ Data that falls outside of the valid data range 
 
Another test strategy is performing a ​dry-run ​of a program, which is when programmers 
manually work through the code. A ​trace table ​is used to note when and which variables 
are updated. If an unexpected result is produced, the cause of this can be traced and  
fixed.
