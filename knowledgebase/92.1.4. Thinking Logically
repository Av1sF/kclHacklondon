Conditions that affect the outcome of a decision 
 
When making a decision, there are certain factors which ultimately determine the outcome  
you choose. There are several key factors that you should take into account:  
- What is most effective? 
- What is most convenient? 
- Is this option reasonable? 
 
To make an appropriate decision, you need to ​evaluate these conditions ​ and order them 
from most important to least important. By prioritising either effectiveness, convenience or  
feasibility, it should become clearer how best to achieve your solution.   
 
 
Decisions affecting the flow of a program 
 
Decisions are made to determine how different parts 
of the program are completed. Say we are tasked 
with designing a simple runner game. We could 
design the game to be endless, or make the game 
level-based. 
 
Again, we would evaluate these conditions using the 
methods described above. It is important to 
understand that both decisions produce completely 
different results, and therefore produce different 
routes through the program.  
 
Thinking logically also involves identifying where decisions need to be made by the user  
within the program, and planning out the outcomes of the decision made. The program will  
follow a different route depending on the decision made by the user.
