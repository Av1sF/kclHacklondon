SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 …  
Where columnX = value   
 
DELETE  
● This is used to ​delete a record ​ from a database table.  
 
For example: 
DELETE FROM TableName  
WHERE columnX = value  
 
Referential Integrity   
● Referential integrity is the process ​ensuring consistency ​. 
● This makes sure that information isn’t removed if it is required elsewhere in a linked 
database.  
 
 
Transaction Processing  
● A transaction is defined as a ​single operation executed on data ​. 
● Transactions must be processed in line with ACID. 
 
ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)  
Atomicity: 
● A transaction must be ​processed in its entirety or not at all ​.  
Consistency: 
● A transaction must keep the ​referential integrity rules ​ between linked tables. 
Isolation: 
● Simultaneous execution of transactions must lead to the ​same result​ as if they were 
executed one after the other. 
Durability 
● Once a transaction has been executed it ​will remain so ​. 
 
Record Locking  
- The process of ​preventing simultaneous access of records ​ in a database. 
- This is used to ​prevent inconsistencies ​ or a ​loss of updates ​. 
- If anyone tries to access the same record they will not be able to.  
- The biggest problem with this is ​deadlock ​.  
 
Redundancy  
- The process of having one or more copies of the data in ​physically different 
locations ​.  
- This means that if there is any damage to one copy the others can be recovered.
