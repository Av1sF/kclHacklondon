Next, Julia is enqueued. The name is added ​at the position of the back pointer ​and the 
back pointer is moved to position 6. 
 
A[0] A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5] A[6] A[7] 
 Rajiv  Sam Jayden  Charlie  Julia   
 ↑     ↑  
 Front      Back   
Now we check the size of the queue. ​6-1 = 5​  and so ​5 ​ is returned. The next operation is 
peek​  which returns the item at the front of the queue, ​Rajiv ​ but does not change the 
queue otherwise. 
The next operation is ​size​ , and because the queue hasn’t changed as a result of the 
peek operation, ​5 ​is returned again. 
 
Next a ​dequeue​  is performed. Rajiv is returned, removed from the queue and the front  
pointer moved to Sam. 
 
A[0] A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5] A[6] A[7]

  ↑    ↑  
  Front     Back   
Finally, the ​isEmpty​  command is performed. Because the values of front and back ​are 
not the same​, False is returned. 
 
The output of the operations is therefore: 
 
Alex, 5, Rajiv, 5, Rajiv, False
