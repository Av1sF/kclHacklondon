It is important to remember that in reality, modern search engines use a much more  
complex algorithm to determine the order in which websites are displayed. These take into  
account various other factors, such as the age of a web page and how quickly content on  
the web page loads. 
 
Server and Client Side Processing 
 
Server side Processing 
Server side processing is when a ​client sends data to a server ​ for it to be processed. This 
means no information is processed on the client computer. Common server side scripting  
languages are ​SQL​ or ​PHP​. Server side processing is useful for several reasons:  
● Does not require ​plugins   
● Can perform ​large calculations ​ much faster than clients 
● Not browser dependent, 
● More ​secure 
 
Client side Processing  
Client side processing is when a client processes the data on a ​local device ​. This means 
that all of the information is processed on the client computer. This is also called client side  
scripting, and uses languages such as ​JavaScript​. This is useful for the following reasons: 
● Webpage can immediately respond to user actions 
● Executes quickly 
● Gives developers more control over the behaviour and look of the website
