● This will allow the table to be sorted on this attribute.  
 
Entity Relationship Modelling  
●One-to-one ​: Each entity can only be linked to one other entity. 
●One-to-many​: One table can be 
associated with many other tables. 
●Many-to-many ​: One entity can be 
associated with many other entities and 
the same applies the other way round  
● The image shows how this is

Handling Data 
 
Capturing Data  
● Data needs to be input into the database and there are various ways of doing this.  
● The chosen method is always dependent on the context.  
● Data may need to be ​manually entered ​ or scanned using methods such as 
Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) ​ which is used with cheques. 
 
Selecting and Managing Data   
● Selecting the correct data is an important part of ​data preprocessing ​. 
● This could involve only selecting data that fits a certain criteria. 
● Collected data can be managed using SQL to sort, restructure and select certain 
sections.  
 
Exchanging Data 
● Exchanging data is the process of ​transferring the data ​ that has been collected.  
● One common example of this is ​EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) ​.
