 
The postfix expression 9 1 + 2 / 7 5 * + is calculated as thus:  
●When both of the ​operands​ are ​immediately preceding​ the​ opcode​,  
the operation is performed. In the above example, this occurs twice,  
once at 9 1 + and at 7 5 *.   
●9 1 + is the same as 9 + 1 which equals 10  
●7 5 * is the same as 7 * 5 which equals 35  
●Now the expression reads 10 2 / 35 +  
●10 and 2 are immediately before the operator /, so the equation 10 2 /  
is performed. It’s​ infix​ equivalent is 10 / 2 which equals 5  
●The expression reads 5 35 + ; there are two pieces of operand before  
the opcode so the equation 5 + 35 is solved which equals 40  
●The answer is 40
