Comparison of Algorithms
Linear Search Algorithm
● An algorithm which traverses through every item one at a time until it finds the item
its searching for
● The Big-O notation for a linear search algorithm is O(n)
Binary Search Algorithm
● A divide and conquer algorithm, this means it splits the list into smaller lists until it
finds the item it’s searching for.
● Since the size of the list is halved every time it’s a Big-O notation of O(log(n))
Bubble Sort Algorithm
● Passes through the list evaluating pairs of items and ensuring the larger value is
above the smaller value
● It has a polynomial Big-O notation, O(n2)
