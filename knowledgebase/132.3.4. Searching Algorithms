 
Linear Search 
● The​ most basic ​searching algorithm 
● Looks at elements one at a time until the desired element is found 
● Doesn’t require the data to be sorted 
● A great deal of ​pot luck​, but ​easy ​to implement 
○ Sometimes ​gets lucky ​and finds the desired element almost ​immediately  
○ In other situations, the algorithm is ​incredibly inefficient  
● Time complexity of ​O(n) 
  
 
A ​= Array of data 
x ​= Desired element 
 
i = 0 
while i < A.length: 
if A[i] == x: 
return i 
else: 
i = i + 1 
endif 
endwhile 
return “Not found in data”
