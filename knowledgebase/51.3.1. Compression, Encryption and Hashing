Hashing 
 
Hashing is the name given to a process in which an input (called a key) is turned into a  
fixed size value (called a hash). There are a vast number of algorithms, called ​hash 
functions​, which do this. 
 
 
Unlike encryption, the output of a hash function ​ can’t be reversed ​ to form the key. This 
quality makes hashing useful for storing passwords. A password entered by a user can be  
hashed and checked against the key to see if it is correct, but 
a successful hacker would only gain access to the keys, 
which ​ can’t be reversed ​to gain the passwords. 
 
Another use of hashing is ​ hash tables ​. A hash table is a data 
structure which holds ​ key-value pairs ​. Formed from an​ array 
and a​ hash function ​, hash tables can be used to lookup data 
in an array in ​ the same amount of time, ​regardless of how 
many values are in the table. When data needs to be 
inserted, it is used as the key for the hash function and 
stored in the bucket corresponding to the hash. 
 
Hash tables are used extensively in situations where a lot of data needs to be stored with  
constant access times. For example, in ​databases ​. 
 
If two pieces of data (keys) produce the ​same ​hash, a ​collision ​is said to have occurred. 
For example, in the image above the keys ​John​  and ​Sandra​  both hash to ​02​ . 
 
A good hash function should have a ​low chance of collision ​and should be ​quick to 
calculate ​.
