Use of object-oriented techniques 
 
● Object-oriented languages are built around the idea of classes 
● A ​class ​is a ​template for an object 
● Classes define the ​state and behaviour of an object  
● Object state is given by ​attributes ​while behaviour is defined by ​methods 
● An ​object ​is a ​particular instance of a class  
●Attributes cannot be directly edited ​ in a technique called ​encapsulation  
● Top-down design applies encapsulation to modules, which are also built to be 
self-contained and reusable
