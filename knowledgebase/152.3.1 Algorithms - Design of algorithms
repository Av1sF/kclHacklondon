b Example answer:
PROCEDURE
ChangeInteger(Value:INTEGER)
INTEGER P, X, M
BOOLEAN NegativeFlag = FALSE
IF Value < 0 THEN
Value = Value*–1
NegativeFlag = TRUE
END IF
REPEAT
P = Value DIV 10
X = P* 10
M = Value –X
OUTPUT M
Value = P
UNTIL Value <= 0
IF NegativeFlag = TRUE THEN
OUTPUT ‘–‘
ELSE
OUTPUT ‘+’
END IF
END PROCEDURE
Checking to see if Value is less than
zero
Correct output of negative value digits
…
… and still correctly outputting positive
value digits.
Output of correct sign4
Alternative possible solution is to use
ABS(M).
Examiner's Comments
Few candidates achieved all the marks
here but many did spot the need to check if
value < 0 and convert the –ve to +ve or
change the sign. They were some
interesting ways of converting (not all
correct) ‐ve to+ve e.g. value = value ‐
(2*value).
