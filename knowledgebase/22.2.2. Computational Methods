 
Visualisation 
Data can be ​ presented in a way that is easier for us to understand ​using ​visualisation ​. This 
makes it possible to ​identify trends that were not otherwise obvious ​, particularly amongst 
statistical data. Depending on the type of data, data may be represented as ​graphs, trees, 
charts and tables ​. Visualisation is another technique that is used by businesses to pick up  
on patterns which can be used to inform business decisions.
