special magnetic ink which can be recognised by a computer but the amount must be  
entered manually. ​Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) ​ is used for multiple choice questions 
on a test. Other forms use​ Optical Character Recognition (OCR) ​. 
 
Selecting and Managing Data   
Selecting the correct data is an important part of ​data preprocessing ​. This could involve 
only selecting data that fits a certain criteria to reduce the volume of input. For example, a  
camera catching speeding cars will only select cars going above a certain speed. Then,  
background information will be removed so only the number plate is added to a record.  
Collected data can alternatively be managed using SQL to sort, restructure and select  
certain sections.  
 
Exchanging Data 
Exchanging data is the process of ​transferring the collected data ​. One common way of 
exchanging data is ​EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) ​. This ​doesn’t require human 
interaction ​ and enables data transfer from one computer to another.
