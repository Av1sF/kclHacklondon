 
Lossy vs Lossless Compression 
 
There are two categories of compression: ​lossy ​and ​lossless ​. As the name suggests, lossy 
compression ​ reduces the size of a file ​while also ​ removing some of its information ​. This 
could result in a ​more pixelated ​ image or​ less clear​ audio recording. On the other hand, 
lossless compression ​reduces the size ​of a file ​without losing any information ​. 
 
When using ​ lossless compression ​, the original file ​can be recovered ​from the compressed 
version. Something which is ​ not possible ​ when using lossy compression which reduces 
the size of the file by ​completely disregarding ​ some information. For example, audio files 
can be compressed lossily by removing the very high or very low frequencies which are  
least noticeable to the ear. There’s no way to go from the lossy version of the recording  
back to the full version as there’s no record of what the high and low frequencies were.
