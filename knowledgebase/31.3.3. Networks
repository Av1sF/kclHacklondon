Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer 
 
Client-server 
Client-server networks consist of ​terminals ​ known as clients connected to a ​server​. The 
server is a​ powerful, central computer ​. The server holds all of the ​important information 
and resources ​ and has ​greater processing power ​ than the terminals. Clients can request 
to use the server.  
 
Advantages of Client-server   Disadvantages of Client-server   
●More ​secure ​as data is stored in one  
location  
●Central backups ​ are carried out so  
there is no need for individual  
backups  
●Data and resources can be ​shared  
between clients  ●Relatively expensive ​ to set up  
●Functionality of terminals depends  
on the server; if this fails,  
performance falls  
●Trained staff are required to  
maintain the server   
 
 
Peer-to-Peer 
A network in which ​ computers are connected to each other ​ so that they can share files. 
Each device effectively acts as both a server and client, as it can both provide and request  
resources. Peer-to-peer networks are used in ​piracy​, since it’s almost ​impossible to trace  
the origin of files.  
 
Advantages of Peer-to-peer  Disadvantages of Peer-to-peer  
●Cheaper to set up  
●Allows users to share resources  
●Easy to maintain  
●Not dependent on a central server  
●Specialist staff are not required  ●Impossible to trace the origin of files  
●Backups must be performed  
separately  
●Poorer security  
●May be difficult to locate resources
