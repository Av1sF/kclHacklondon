Comparison of Algorithms
The exam board will mostly compare the time complexity. Occasionally they will mention
space complexity although it’s important to just understand the smaller the space
complexity the better the algorithm is.
Linear Search Algorithm
A linear search algorithm is an algorithm which traverses through every item one at a time
until it finds the item its searching for. The Big-O notation for a linear search algorithm is
O(n).
Binary Search Algorithm
A binary search algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm, this means it splits the list into
smaller lists until it finds the item it’s searching for, since the size of the list is halved every
time it’s a Big-O notation of O(log(n)) .
Bubble Sort Algorithm
The bubble sort algorithm passes through the list evaluating pairs of items and ensuring
the larger value is above the smaller value. It has a polynomial Big-O notation, O(n2).
