 
Writing and following algorithms  
 
● Algorithm = a ​set of instructions used to solve a problem  
● All good algorithms have certain ​key qualities: 
○ Inputs must be ​clearly defined ​ - what is valid and what is invalid? 
○ Must always produce a ​valid output for any defined input 
○ Must be able to ​deal with invalid inputs  
○ Must always reach a ​ stopping condition 
○ Must be ​well-documented ​ for reference 
○ Must be ​well-commented ​ so modifications can easily be made  
 
Test Strategies 
 
There are various types of testing that can be carried out: 
 
● Alpha testing 
○Carried out ​ ​in-house ​ by software development teams 
○ Bugs are pinpointed and fixed 
● Beta testing 
○Carried out by end-users ​. 
○Feedback from users ​ informs next stage of development 
● White box testing 
○ Carried out by software development teams  
○Internal structure of program ​ is recognised  
○ All ​possible routes through the program ​ are tested 
● Black box testing 
○Testers are not aware of the internal structure ​ of the software 
○ Test plan traces through ​ inputs and outputs  
 
● Testing pinpoints any flaws in the software 
● Software should produce the ​ correct output​ or an ​appropriate error for any input 
● There are three types of data that programmers must consider when testing: 
○ Normal 
Data within the range and of the data type considered as valid 
○ Boundary  
Data that falls at either of the ends of the valid data range 
○ Erroneous 
Data that falls outside of the valid data range 
● Another test strategy is performing a ​dry-run 
● Programmers manually work through the code and produce a ​ trace table 
● This records ​when and which variables are updated
