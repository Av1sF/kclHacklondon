 
-Encapsulation ​is a key reason for choosing OOP as it makes the ​code more reliable 
by ​protecting attribute ​s from being directly accessed. Code for different classes can 
also be ​produced independently ​ of others. 
- OOP requires ​advance planning ​ to determine how the problem will be broken down 
into classes and how these will link to each other. A ​thorough design ​ can produce a 
higher-quality piece of software with ​fewer vulnerabilities ​.  
- The ​modular structure ​ used in OOP ​makes it easy to maintain and update ​. 
- There is a high level of ​abstraction ​and it is not necessary for programmers to know 
details about how code is implemented. Once classes have been created and  
tested, they can be reused as a ​ black box​ which ​saves time and effort​. 
 
Disadvantages 
- This is a different style of programming and so ​ requires an alternative style of 
thinking ​. This can be difficult for programmers accustomed to other paradigms to  
pick up. 
- OOP is​ not suited to all types of problems ​. Where few components are reused, 
OOP may in fact result in a​ longer, more inefficient program ​. 
- Generally ​unsuitable for smaller problems ​.
