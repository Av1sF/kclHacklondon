The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 
 
Sometimes referred to as ​RIPA​, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act covers 
investigation, surveillance and interception of communication ​ by ​public bodies ​. For 
example, the Secret Service can legally wire-trap online conversations in the interests of  
national security provided that a ​warrant ​has been issued. 
 
Furthermore, the act enforces​ internet service providers ​ and ​mobile phone companies ​ to 
give up information upon request from an authorised authority and to ensure that their  
networks have sufficient hardware installed to ​facilitate surveillance ​. 
 
This Act is particularly controversial as ​its powers extend to small agencies ​like local 
councils. In addition, some people feel that the Act is an ​ invasion of privacy ​, or that it is 
often ​improperly used ​.
