RAM and ROM 
 
So far, we’ve seen ​secondary storage devices ​, used to store user data like images and 
videos. RAM and ROM are two types of primary storage, used by the computer’s operating  
system to run the computer. They store information like code instructions to execute and  
files which are required by running programs. 
 
RAM 
Random access memory is a type of ​fast ​main memory used to store data and 
programs that the computer is currently using. This speeds up the computer’s  
execution as RAM has higher access speeds than even flash memory. RAM is  
more expensive per gigabyte ​ than secondary storage devices, so computers often 
have only 4 or 8 GB or RAM compared to 100s or 1000s of GB of secondary  
storage.  
 
RAM is volatile, meaning that it loses its information when power is lost.  
 
ROM 
Read only memory, as the name suggests, ​cannot be modified ​. Once programmed, 
the state of the memory cells inside does not changed. ROM is non-volatile, so it  
retains its data even when the computer is powered off. 
 
 
Virtual Storage 
 
Virtual storage is the name given to storing information ​remotely ​so that it can be accessed 
by any computer with access to the same system, for example over the Internet. Examples  
of virtual storage include ​cloud storage services ​like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive 
as well as networked storage used in offices and schools. 
 
As internet speeds increase, virtual storage is becoming a more popular method of storage  
thanks to the convenience of files being available “in the cloud” on any device connected  
to the Internet. 
 
While virtual storage is ​convenient ​to access and share, its disadvantages include 
limitations of a user’s network speed and ​ high costs​.
