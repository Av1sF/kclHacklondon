Translators 
 
● A program that ​converts source code into object code ​. There are three types:  
 
Compiler 
● Translate high-level code into machine code ​all at once ​.  
●Initial compilation process is longer ​ than using other translators. 
● Compiled code is ​platform-specific 
● Compiled code can be run ​without a translator ​ present. 
 
Interpreter 
●Translate and execute code line-by-line ​.  
● Produce an error if a line contains an error.  
●Slower than running compiled code ​. 
●Correct interpreter required to run ​ on different platforms. 
● Code is ​platform-independent.  
● Useful for ​testing ​code. 
 
Assembler  
● Assembly code is a low-level language that is ​platform specific ​. 
● Assemblers translate assembly code into machine code. 
●Each line of assembly code is equivalent to almost one line of machine code ​.
