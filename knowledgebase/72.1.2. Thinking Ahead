 
reusable components means that they can be ​reused in future projects ​,​ saving 
development costs ​. However, it may not always be possible to integrate existing 
components due to ​compatibility issues ​ with the rest of the software. This might mean 
these components need to be modified to work with existing software, which can  
sometimes be more costly and time-consuming than developing them in-house.

Caching 
 
Caching is the process of ​storing instructions or values in cache memory ​ after they have 
been used, as they ​ may be used again ​. This ​saves time​ which would have been needed to 
retrieve the instructions from secondary storage again. ​Frequently-accessed web pages  
are cached which means that the next time one of these pages is accessed, content can  
be​ loaded without delay ​. This also means images and text do not have to be downloaded 
multiple times, ​ freeing up bandwidth ​ for other tasks on a network. 
 
A variation of caching is ​prefetching ​, in which ​algorithms predict which instructions are 
likely to soon be fetched ​. These instructions are then ​loaded and stored in cache before 
they are fetched​. By thinking ahead, therefore, ​less time is spent waiting ​for instructions to 
be loaded into RAM from the hard disk. 
 
One of the biggest limitations to prefetching is the ​accuracy of the algorithms used ​, as they 
can ​only provide an informed prediction ​ as to the instructions which are likely to be used. 
Similarly, the effectiveness of caching depends on how well a caching algorithm is able to  
manage the cache. Larger caches take a long time to search and so ​cache size limits how 
much data can be stored ​.  
 
In general, this form of thinking ahead can be ​difficult to implement ​ but can significantly 
improve performance if implemented effectively.
