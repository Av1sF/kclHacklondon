 
Layout, Colour Paradigms and Character Sets 
 
Layout 
When web developers design websites, it is important that they consider ​who will be 
viewing the website ​ and ensure the website is designed to accommodate for all of these  
people. The ​Equality Act​ introduced in 2010 makes it ​illegal to discriminate against 
providing a service to a certain group of people ​, which makes this even more important. 
 
Websites must be laid out in a way that makes it ​easy for users to navigate between 
pages ​. Menus are a common tool used to provide function and in English-speaking  
countries, menus are displayed on the left-hand side of the page. In countries such as  
Egypt or the UAE, where Arabic is the primary language, these menus may instead be  
displayed on the right-hand side of the page as Arabic is read from right to left. These sort  
of​ design considerations ​ must be made by developers in order to make websites 
accessible to all people ​. This is particularly important for online stores, as a well laid-out  
website which is easy-to-navigate will ​attract more customers​. 
 
Websites must also be designed in a way that makes them accessible to people with  
visual impairments ​or other disabilities. Some people may need to ​enlarge text or alter the 
contrast ​in order to view the contents of the website comfortably and a good website will  
cater for this. Websites should provide ​alternative text​ (alt text) for images and provide a 
screen magnifier option ​ so people with visual impairments are not disadvantaged. 
Transcripts ​of audio files should be provided for those with hearing impairments.  
 
Colour Paradigms 
When choosing a colour scheme for a website, web developers must take into account  
how different colours are interpreted ​ around the world. Some colours are regarded as 
unlucky in certain cultures and have other negative connotations. For example, while white  
is associated with mourning in the Middle East, it is associated with purity in Western  
cultures. Typically, a neutral colour scheme with widely positive connotations will be  
chosen, such as green which represents luck and nature. 
 
Character Sets 
In order to make websites accessible to as wide an 
audience as possible, the contents must be ​translated into 
multiple languages ​. Some character sets are too small to 
accommodate all of the characters of a language. ASCII 
only uses seven bits and so is unable to represent all of the 
characters in the Chinese language. Therefore ​ Unicode is 
the preferred character set ​as it is able to represent ​ over a 
million characters ​.
