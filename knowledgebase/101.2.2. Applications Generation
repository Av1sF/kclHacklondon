●Increases the size of the file ​.  
Dynamic Linker 
●Addresses of modules/ libraries ​ are added to the file. 
●External module/library updates automatically feed through ​ to the main file. 
 
Loaders 
● Programs provided by the operating system.  
●Fetches the library/ module from the given memory location ​. 
 
Use of Libraries 
●Pre-compiled programs ​which can be incorporated within other programs.
