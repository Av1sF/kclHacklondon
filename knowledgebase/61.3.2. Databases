ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)  
Atomicity: 
- A transaction must be ​processed in its entirety or not at all ​,  
Consistency: 
- A transaction must maintain the ​referential integrity rules ​ between linked tables, 
Isolation: 
- Simultaneous executions of transactions should lead to the ​same result​ as if they 
were executed one after the other, 
Durability 
- Once a transaction has been executed it ​will remain so ​ regardless of the 
circumstances surrounding it, such as in the event of a power cut.  
 
Record Locking  
The process of ​preventing simultaneous access to records ​ in a database is called record 
locking and it is used in order to ​prevent inconsistencies ​ or a ​loss of updates ​. While one 
person is editing a record, this ‘locks’ the record so others cannot access the same record.  
The biggest problem with this is ​deadlock ​, described below. 
- User 1 accesses Customer 1’s record and as a result locks Customer 1’s record. 
Simultaneously User 2 accesses Customer 2’s record and as a result locks  
Customer 2’s record. 
- Now User 1 tries to access Customer 2’s record, and User 2 tries to access 
Customer 1’s record. 
- User 1 waits for Customer 2’s record to be free and User 2 waits for Customer 1’s 
record to be free and as they are both waiting, there is no progress causing a  
deadlock.  
 
Redundancy  
There is some information that people and companies cannot afford to lose. Redundancy  
is the process of having one or more copies of the data in ​physically different locations ​. 
This means that if there is any damage to one copy the others can be recovered.
