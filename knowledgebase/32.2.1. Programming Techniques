Use of an IDE 
 
An​ Integrated Development Environment ​, or IDE, is a ​program ​which provides a s ​et 
of tools​ to make it easier for programmers to ​write, develop and debug code ​. 
Common features of IDEs include: 
 
- Stepping 
This allows you to ​monitor the effect of each individual line of code ​ by  
executing a single line at a time. 
 
- Variable watch 
This allows users to observe how the ​contents of a variable change ​ in 
real-time. 
 
- Breakpoint 
IDEs allow users to ​set a point in the program at which the program will 
stop​. 
 
- Source code editor 
The editor provides features such as ​autocompletion ​ of words,  
indentation ​, syntax ​highlighting ​and automatic bracket completion. 
 
- Debugging tools 
Some IDEs also provide ​run-time detection of error ​s with a guide as to 
where in the code they are likely to have occurred. 
 
Use of object-oriented techniques 
 
Object-oriented languages are built around the idea of classes. A ​class ​is a ​template 
for an object ​and defines the ​state and behaviour of an object ​. State is given by 
attributes ​while behaviour is defined by ​methods. 
 
Classes can be used to create objects by a process called ​instantiation ​. An ​object ​is 
a ​particular instance of a class ​, and a class can be used to create multiple objects 
with the same set of attributes and methods. 
 
In object-oriented programming, ​attributes are declared as private so can only be 
altered by public methods ​. This is called ​encapsulation ​. Encapsulation is a technique 
used throughout programming to implement the principle of ​information hiding ​. This 
is when programs are made ​less complex ​by ​protecting data from being accidentally 
edited ​ by other parts of the program. Top-down design implements the same  
principle of encapsulation, as each module is designed to be self-contained.
