Peer-to-Peer 
A network in which ​ computers are connected to each other ​ so that they can share files. 
Each device effectively acts as both a server and client, as it can both provide and request  
resources. Peer-to-peer networks are used in ​piracy​, since it’s almost ​impossible to trace  
the origin of files.
