 
Drawbacks of concurrent processing 
● Concurrent processing can take longer to complete when large numbers of users or 
tasks are involved as processes cannot be completed at once. 
● There is an​ overhead in coordinating ​ and switching between processes, which 
reduces program throughput. 
● Just as with parallel processing, not all tasks are suited to being broken up and 
performed concurrently.
