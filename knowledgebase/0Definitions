execute a single simple instruction each clock cycle. This uses more RAM but allows
pipelining.
1.1.3 Input, Output and Storage
Flash Storage: A solid state technology that stores data on a collection of memory chips. No
moving parts as data is accessed by software.
Input Devices: Peripheral devices that allow the user communicate and to pass readable
data into a computer, decode it and send it to the CPU.
Magnetic Storage: Relies on the polarisation of magnetic particles to store bits on a
magnetic material which is typically moved mechanically. A high capacity and low cost
means of storage.
Optical Storage: Data is stored in the reflectivity (pits and lands) of a surface, and is read
and written to by a laser.
Output Devices: Peripheral devices that take convert signals from a computer into a
human-readable form.
Random Access Memory (RAM): Memory used to store programs and data in use by the
computer. Quick access times by all data is lost when the computer is turned off (volatile
memory).
Read-Only Memory (ROM): Memory used to store information that is permanently required
to boot up and run the computer. Cannot be written to and is non-volatile.
Storage Device:  Any medium on which data can be stored even when powered off.
Virtual Storage: Using the hard disk as though it were an extension of memory to free up
more RAM for current programs.
