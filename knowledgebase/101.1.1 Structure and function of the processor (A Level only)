1 a – An instruction can be fetched as the
previous one is being decoded …
– … and the one before that is being
executed.
– E.g.
  can be fetched, while 
 is being decoded and 
 is being executed.
(1 per –) 3
b – BRP could be followed by one of two
possible instructions, which one will only
be determined at execution
– Meaning the wrong one may be fetched
/ decoded
(1 per –)2
c – Clock speed
– Cache Size
– Number of cores (1 per max 1)1

2 Pipelining would allow one instruction to be
fetched as the previous one is being
decoded and the one before that is being
executed.(1)
For example OUT could be fetched (1). As
there are no jump/branch instructions it
pipelines well (as there is no need to flush
the pipeline). (1) 3 Accept any valid example from the given
code.
