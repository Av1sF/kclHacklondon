Insertion Sort 
● Places elements ​into a sorted sequence  
● In the ​i​th​ iteration of the algorithm the first ​i​  elements of the array are sorted 
○ Warning: although the ​i​ elements are ​sorted​, they are not the ​i​  ​smallest 
elements ​in the input! 
● Stars at the​ second element ​in the input, and compares it to the element ​to its left 
● When compared, elements are ​ inserted into the correct position ​in the sorted 
portion of the input to their left 
● This continues until the last element is inserted into the correct position, resulting in 
a fully sorted array 
● Has the same time complexity as bubble sort, ​O(n​2​) 
 
A = ​ Array of data 
 
for i = 1 to A.length - 1: 
elem = A[i] 
j = i - 1 
while j > 0 and A[j] > elem: 
A[j+1] = A[j] 
j = j - 1 
A[j+1] = elem
