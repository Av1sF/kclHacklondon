 
Compiler 
Translate high-level code into machine code ​all at once ​. The ​initial compilation process is 
longer ​ than using an interpreter or an assembler.  
Compiled code is ​specific to a particular processor type 
and operating system ​ but can be run ​without a translator  
present. 
 
Interpreter 
Translate and execute code line-by-line ​. They stop and 
produce an error if a line contains an error.  
Initially appear faster ​ than compilers, but are ​slower than 
running compiled code ​ as ​code must be interpreted each time it is executed. ​Code ​ also 
requires the correct interpreter in order to run ​ on different devices. 
Interpreters are useful for ​testing ​code, as time is not wasted compiling code with errors. 
Code is also ​ platform-independent ​, making interpreted code ​ more portable ​.  
 
Assembler  
Assembly Code 
A low-level language and is the ​‘next level up’ from 
machine code ​. Assembly code is ​platform specific ​. 
 
Assemblers translate assembly code into machine code. 
Each line of assembly code is equivalent to almost one 
line of machine code ​.
