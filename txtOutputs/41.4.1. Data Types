Character Sets for Representing Text 
 
A character set is a published collection of codes and corresponding characters which can  
be used by computers for representing text. 
 
Two widely used character sets are ​ASCII ​and ​Unicode ​. 
 
ASCII 
Standing for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, ASCII was the leading  
character set before Unicode. ASCII uses 7 bits to represent 2 ​7​ = 128 different characters. 
The capital letters A-Z are represented by codes 65-90 while the lower case letters a-z  
correspond to codes 97-122. There are also codes for ​numbers ​and ​symbols​. 
 
While 128 characters is plenty for standard letters, numbers and symbols, ASCII soon  
came into trouble when computers needed to represent other languages with different  
characters. 
 
Unicode 
Unicode solves the problem of ASCII’s limited character set. Unicode uses a ​varying 
number of bits​ allowing for over 1 million different characters, many of which have yet to  
be allocated. Because of this, Unicode has enough capacity to represent a wealth of  
different languages, symbols and emoji.
