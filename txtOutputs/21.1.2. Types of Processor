Multi-core and Parallel Systems 
 
Multi-core CPUs have ​multiple independent cores ​ that can complete instructions 
separately which results in higher performance. Parallel systems accomplish a similar task  
however instead of requiring multiple cores they can complete tasks with a single core, by   
 
using ​threading ​. Generally, multi-core systems perform better in larger projects than  
parallel systems.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) 
 
A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a device which unlike CPUs has ​lots of independent 
processors ​ which work in parallel making it very efficient at completing ​repetitive tasks 
such as image processing and machine learning. GPUs are a type of ​co-processor ​ (a 
secondary processor designed to supplement the activities of the primary processor).
