 
Object Oriented Languages 
 
Classes, Objects, Methods and Attributes  
● A ​class ​is a​ template for an object ​ and defines the ​state and behaviour of an object 
● State is given by ​attributes ​which give an ​object’s properties  
● Behaviour is defined by the ​methods,​ which ​describe the actions it can perform  
● Classes can be used to ​ create objects​ by a process called ​instantiation 
● An ​object ​is a ​particular instance of a class ​, and a class can be used to create 
multiple objects 
● A ​setter ​is a method that​ sets the value of a particular attribute  
● A ​getter ​is another special method used in OOP which ​ retrieves the value of a given 
attribute 
● Getters and setters ensure​ attributes cannot be directly accessed and edited ​ but 
can only be altered by public methods ​. This is called ​encapsulation.  
● Every class must also have a ​constructor method which ​allows a new object to be 
created 
 
Inheritance  
● Process in which ​subclass ​inherits all of the methods and attributes ​ ​of the  
superclass 
● Subclass can also have its ​own additional properties 
 
Polymorphism 
● Enables ​objects to behave differently depending on their class  
Overloading 
● Passing in ​different parameters ​into a method 
Overriding 
●Redefining a method ​ so that it ​functions differently ​and ​produces a different output  
 
Advantages of OOP 
● High level of ​reusability 
●Code made more reliable ​through encapsulation 
● Makes code easy to ​ maintain and update 
● Casses can be reused as a ​ black box​ which ​saves time and effort 
 
Disadvantages of OOP 
● Requires an ​alternative style of thinking  
● Not suited to ​all types of problems 
● Generally ​unsuitable for smaller problems
