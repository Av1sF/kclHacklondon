There are some problems with this, the biggest of which is ​deadlock ​. The easiest way to 
explain this is through an example: 
- User 1 accesses Customer 1’s record and as a result locks Customer 1’s record. 
Simultaneously User 2 accesses Customer 2’s record and as a result locks  
Customer 2’s record. 
- Now User 1 tries to access Customer 2’s record, and User 2 tries to access 
Customer 1’s record. 
- User 1 waits for Customer 2’s record to be free and User 2 waits for Customer 1’s 
record to be free and as they are both waiting, there is no progress causing a  
deadlock.  
 
Redundancy  
Some information is very important and people and companies cannot afford to lose this  
information. This is where redundancy comes in. Redundancy is the process of having one  
or more copies of the data in ​physically different locations ​. This means that if there is any 
damage to one copy the others will remain unaffected and can be recovered.
