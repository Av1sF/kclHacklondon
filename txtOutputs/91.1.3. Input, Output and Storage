■ Primary disadvantage is ​cost 
■ Another disadvantage is limited lifespan 
● When a page is written to, the voltage required increases 
● Over time, this will become too high 
 
RAM and ROM 
 
● Two types of ​primary storage  
● Store information like ​code instructions ​ to execute and ​files ​which are ​required by 
running programs  
● RAM 
○ Random access memory 
○ A type of ​fast, volatile ​main memory 
○ Used to store data and programs that the computer is currently using 
○ Speeds up the computer’s execution 
○ Higher access speeds than even flash memory 
○More expensive per gigabyte ​ than secondary storage devices 
○ Computers often have only 4 or 8 GB or RAM 
● ROM 
○ Read only memory 
○ Non-volatile 
○Cannot ​be modified 
○ Once programmed, the state of the memory cells inside does not changed 
○ Useful for storing fixed sequences of instructions like a computer’s startup 
(bootstrap) routine 
 
Virtual Storage 
 
● Name given to storing information ​remotely ​so that it can be accessed by any 
computer with access to the same system, for example over the Internet 
● Examples include ​cloud storage services ​and networked storage used in offices and 
schools 
● As internet speeds increase, virtual storage is becoming more popular  
● Often an​ abstraction of multiple drives ​acting like one 
● Disadvantages include limitations of a user’s network speed and ​ high costs
