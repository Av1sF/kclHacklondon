Optimisation Algorithms  
 
●Find the ​best possible solution ​ to the problem posed  
●The only optimisation algorithm that you must be aware of is ​Dijkstra’s  
(pronounced dyke-struh’s) ​algorithm  
 
Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 
●Finds the ​shortest path​ from a starting node to ​every other node ​ in a network  
●Is similar to the breadth-first search algorithm, but keeps track of visited nodes  
with a priority queue rather than a standard queue  
●These points may be modelled as ​nodes ​in a ​weighted graph  
●Used in ​ satellite navigation systems ​ to find the ​shortest route​ between locations  
●Used in ​routers ​to send packets via the ​fastest route​ through a network
