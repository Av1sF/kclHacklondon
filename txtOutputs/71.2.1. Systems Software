 
● Multi-user 
- Multiple users make use of one computer.  
- A ​scheduling algorithm Is used ​ to allocate processor time fairly between jobs 
and prevent ​ processor starvation. 
● Real Time 
- Used in ​time-critical computer systems ​ and designed to perform a task within 
a ​guaranteed time frame ​. 
 
BIOS 
 
●Basic Input Output System​ is the first program that runs when a computer system is 
switched on.  
● Runs a series of tests before the operating system is loaded into memory: 
●POST (Power-on self test)​ which ensures that all hardware is correctly connected 
and functional 
● Checking the CPU clock, memory and processor  
● Testing for external memory devices  
 
 
Device Drivers 
 
● Computer programs that allow the operating system to ​interact with hardware ​.  
● Are ​specific to the computer’s architecture ​.  
●Specific to the operating system   
 
Virtual Machines 
 
● A ​theoretical computer ​ and a ​software implementation of a computer system ​. 
● Provides an ​environment with a translator ​ for intermediate code to run. 
 
Intermediate Code 
●Code halfway between machine code and object code ​is called intermediate code.  
●Independent of processor architecture ​ so can run across different machines and 
operating systems.  
● Takes longer to execute than low-level code 
 
Uses of virtual machines include: 
● Testing programs 
● Protection from malware 
● Running software compatible with different versions/ types of operating systems
