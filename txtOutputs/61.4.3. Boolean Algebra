Full Adder 
A full adder is ​ similar to a half adder ​, but has an ​additional input ​, allowing for ​carry in ​to be 
represented. The full adder logic circuit is formed from two XOR gates, two AND gates and  
an OR gate as shown in the diagram. 
 
 
The truth table for a full adder is shown below. There are eight rows as opposed to the four  
rows of the half adder due to the additional third input, C ​in​. 
 
A B C ​in C ​out Sum  
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 1 
0 1 0 0 1 
0 1 1 1 0 
1 0 0 0 1 
1 0 1 1 0 
1 1 0 1 0 
1 1 1 1 1 
 
Because the full adder has a carry input, the circuits can be ​chained together ​to form an 
adder with as many inputs as is required.
