11Server and Client Side Processing 
Server side Processing 
Server side processing is when a ​client sends data to a server ​ for it to be processed. This 
means no information is processed on the client computer. The common server side  
scripting languages are ​SQL​ or ​PHP​. Server side processing is beneficial for a few 
reasons:  
● Doesn’t require ​plugins ​ etc 
● Can perform ​large calculations ​ much faster than clients, 
● Not browser dependent, 
● It’s more ​secure​, 
 
Client side Processing  
Client side processing is when a client processes the data on its ​local device ​. This means 
all of the information is processed on the client computer. This is also called client side  
scripting, and uses languages such as ​JavaScript​. This is beneficial for a few reasons: 
● Webpage can immediately respond to user actions, 
● Execute quickly, 
● Gives developers more control over the behaviour and look of the website,
