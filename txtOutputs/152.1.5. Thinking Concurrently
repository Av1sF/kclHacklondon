Thinking Concurrently  
 
Concurrent Thinking  
● Concurrent thinking is the process of completing ​more than one task ​ at a given 
time. 
● Does not always mean you have to be working on multiple tasks at once. 
● Involves giving ‘slices’ of your time to different tasks. 
● Parts of a problem which are related can often be solved concurrently. 
 
Concurrent Processing 
●Concurrent processing ​and ​parallel processing ​ are not the same thing 
● Parallel processing is when ​multiple processors ​ are used to complete more than 
one task simultaneously 
● In concurrent processing, each task is given ​ a slice​ of processor time to make it 
appear as if tasks are being completed ​simultaneously ​.  
● In reality, tasks are executed sequentially. 
 
Benefits of concurrent processing  
● The ​number of tasks completed in a given time ​ is increased. 
●Less time is wasted waiting ​ for an input or user interaction, as other tasks can be 
completed in this time. 
 
Drawbacks of concurrent processing 
● Concurrent processing can take longer to complete when large numbers of users or 
tasks are involved as processes cannot be completed at once. 
● There is an​ overhead in coordinating ​ and switching between processes, which 
reduces program throughput. 
● Just as with parallel processing, not all tasks are suited to being broken up and 
performed concurrently.
