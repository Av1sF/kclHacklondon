Merge Sort  
 
●An example of a ​ “divide and conquer” ​ sorting algorithm  
●Divides an array ​into smaller arrays ​until each array contains ​just one element  
●When an array has just one element, it can be considered an ​ordered array  
●Arrays are then​ merged back together ​in order to form an ordered array  
●Has a time complexity of ​O(nlogn)  
●An ​efficient ​sorting algorithm  
 
 
 
 
In the example above, the array is ​split down the middle ​ and then​ continues to be split  
until each resulting array is just one element in size. The arrays are then ​ merged back  
together ​in the correct order.
