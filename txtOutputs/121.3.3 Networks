Although most candidates stated that a
WAN is a wide area network, many did not
go on to state that devices on a WAN are
connected over a large geographical area.

Examiner’s Comments
Most candidates explained what a protocol
is rather than why they are important on a
network. Candidates should be
encouraged to apply their knowledge to the
question being asked. Some candidates
gained credit for correctly explaining that
protocols enable devices to interpret data
in the same way, allowing them to
communicate.
ii - Application
- Transport
- Internet
- Network Interface/(Data) Link/Physical
