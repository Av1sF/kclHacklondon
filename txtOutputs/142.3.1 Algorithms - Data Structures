  Mark Scheme
7 a 1 mark per bullet to max 3
e.g.
A queue is First In First Out (FIFO) [1]
The questions are retrieved in the
order they are stored [1]
Questions can be added to the end [1]
Dynamic structure… [1]
…expands to take more questions [1]3

Examiner's Comment:
Many candidates understood that a queue
was a FIFO structure, but fewer could then
go on to explain in context why this would
then be a suitable data structure for the
problem in context.
b 1 mark for pseudocode/code that meets
each bullet
Checking if queue is empty [1]
…outputting message/reporting
error [1]
Outputting element in questions at
index head [1]
Increment head [1]
e.g.

Examiner's Comment:
Again, the use of pseudocode posed
problems for many candidates. Those who
had a wider programming experience were
apparent from the well-crafted solutions.
Those who gained credit generally gained
two marks for understanding how the
pointers were updated and how data was
added/removed. Fewer scored full marks
by also performing error checking.
