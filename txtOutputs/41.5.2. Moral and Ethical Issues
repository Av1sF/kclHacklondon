 
Piracy is the ​unauthorised copying of content ​, such as software or media. This is a ​form of 
theft and is illegal ​, although the Internet has made it easier than ever before to source  
these types of content online. 
 
While the Internet has opened up countless positive pathways, it also provides a  
seemingly anonymous front ​ for people. Offensive communication refers to any sort of 
online harassment, including cyber-bullying or stalking ​. The ​Malicious Communications Act  
introduced in 1998 makes it a ​ criminal offence to send indecent or offensive messages to 
anyone online ​. 
 
 
Layout, Colour Paradigms and Character Sets 
 
Layout 
When web developers design websites, it is important that they consider ​who will be 
viewing the website ​ and ensure the website is designed to accommodate for all of these  
people. The ​Equality Act​ introduced in 2010 makes it ​illegal to discriminate against 
providing a service to a certain group of people ​, which makes this even more important. 
 
Websites must be laid out in a way that makes it ​easy for users to navigate between 
pages ​. Menus must be displayed on the appropriate side of the page depending on how  
the language is read.  
 
Websites must be accessible to people with ​visual impairments ​ who may need to ​enlarge 
text or alter the contrast ​in order to view the contents of the website. Websites should 
provide ​alternative text​ for images and provide a ​screen magnifier option ​ so people with 
visual impairments. ​Transcripts ​of audio files should be provided for those with hearing 
impairments. 
 
Colour Paradigms 
When choosing a colour scheme for a website, web developers must take into account  
how different colours are interpreted ​ around the world. Some colours are regarded as 
unlucky in certain cultures and have other negative connotations.   
 
Character Sets 
In order to make websites accessible to as wide an 
audience as possible, the contents must be ​translated into 
multiple languages ​. ​Unicode is the preferred character set 
as it is able to represent ​ over a million characters ​.
