 
Character Sets for Representing Text 
 
● A published collection of codes and corresponding characters 
● Can be used by computers for representing text 
● Two widely used character sets are ASCII and Unicode 
 
ASCII 
● American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
● The leading character set before Unicode 
● Uses 7 bits to represent 2 ​7​ = 128 different characters 
● ASCII soon came into trouble when computers needed to represent other 
languages with different characters 
 
Unicode 
● Solves the problem of ASCII’s limited character set 
● Uses a ​varying number of bits ​ allowing for over 1 million different characters 
● Many characters have yet to be allocated 
● Enough capacity to represent a wealth of different languages, symbols, and emoji
