Searches through the code for areas it could be made more efficient to ​ reduce execution 
time ​but is a ​very time-consuming ​ of compilation.  
Redundant parts of code are removed ​. Repeated sections of code are replaced with more 
efficient code. Excessive optimisation may alter the way in which the program behaves.  
 
Linkers, Loaders and Use of Libraries 
 
Linkers 
A piece of software responsible for ​ linking external modules and libraries included within 
the code​.  
Static Linker 
Modules and libraries are ​added directly ​ into the main file. This ​increases the size of the 
file​.  
Dynamic Linker 
Addresses of modules and libraries ​ are included in the file. ​File size does not change ​ and 
external module/library updates automatically feed through to the main file ​. 
 
Loaders 
Programs provided by the operating system. When a file with dynamically linked  
addresses is executed, the ​loader retrieves the library or module from the specified 
memory location ​. 
 
Use of Libraries 
Pre-compiled programs ​which can be incorporated within other programs. They are 
ready-to-use and error free ​, so ​save time ​developing and testing modules. Libraries ​can be 
reused ​ across multiple programs and ​save programmers from having to ‘reinvent the 
wheel’ ​ and instead make use of others’ expertise.
