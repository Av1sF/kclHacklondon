RISC and CISC processors 
 
Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC)  
● Small instruction set 
● Each instruction is one line of machine code 
● Used in common computers 
● Pipelining is possible since each instruction takes one clock cycle 
 
Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC) 
● Large instruction set 
● Instructions are built into the hardware 
● Used in microcontrollers and embedded systems 
● The compiler has less work to do  
● Less RAM is required to store the code 
● Many specialised instructions are made, even though only a few of them are used 
 
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) 
A-Level only 
● A co-processor made up of lots of independent processors  
● Efficient at tasks such as image processing and machine learning  
 
 
Multi-core and Parallel Systems 
 
● Multi-core CPUs have multiple independent cores that complete separate 
fetch-execute cycles 
● Parallel systems complete multiple instructions simultaneously using techniques like 
pipelining, it can be completed using a single core and threading
