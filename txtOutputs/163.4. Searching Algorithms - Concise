Searching Algorithms  
 
●A ​searching algorithm ​ is used to find a ​specified data item ​ within a ​set of data  
 
 
Linear Search   
 
●Can be conducted on ​any list​, even if the data isn’t in order  
●Works by inspecting every item in a list ​one by one ​ until the desired item is found  
●Very simple ​ to program  
●Comparatively ​high time complexity ​ of​ ​O(N)  
●If the target ​does not exist​ in the list, the algorithm will still ​check every single  
item​ in the list  
 
 
Binary Search  
 
●Can only be used on ​ordered ​lists 
●Works by looking at the ​midpoint ​of a list and determining if the ​target ​is ​higher or  
lower ​than the midpoint  
●More efficient than the linear search algorithm  
●Midpoint calculated by ​adding the first and last positions ​ of the data, and ​dividing  
by two  
●The list of data is ​halved ​with each iteration  
●Can be implemented both ​iteratively ​and ​recursively  
●Good time complexity of ​O(logN)  
 
 
 
Binary Tree Search  
 
●The same as a binary search, but conducted on a ​ ​binary tree  
●A binary tree is a ​rooted​,​ ordered tree ​ in which ​each node has no more than 2  
children  
●Can be implemented both ​iteratively ​and ​recursively  
●Same time complexity as binary search, ​O(logN)
