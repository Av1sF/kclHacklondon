writing functions on its programmers; the
material is generally accurate but at times
underdeveloped.
The candidate is able to apply their
knowledge and understanding directly to
the context provided although one or two
opportunities are missed. Evidence /
examples are for the most part implicitly
relevant to the explanation.
The candidate provides a reasonable
discussion, the majority of which is
focused. Evaluative comments are for the
most part appropriate, although one or two
opportunities for development are missed.
There is a line of reasoning presented with
some structure. The information presented
is in the most part relevant and supported
by some evidence.
Mark Band 1–Low Level
(1–3 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a basic
knowledge of reasons why an organisation
enforces standard rules about writing
functions on its programmers with limited
understanding shown; the material is basic
and contains some inaccuracies. The
candidate makes a limited attempt to apply
acquired knowledge and understanding to
the context provided.
The candidate provides a limited
discussion which is narrow in focus.
Judgments if made are weak and
unsubstantiated.
The information is basic and
communicated in an unstructured way. The
information is supported by limited
evidence and the relationship to the
evidence may not be clear.
0 marks
No attempt to answer the question or
response is not worthy of credit. be directly related to the specific question.
The following is indicative of possible
factors / evidence that candidates may
refer to but is not prescriptive or
exhaustive:
Explanation of how the standard rules
for programming would impact upon
the choices made for using functions
and variables and how they are
addressed.
Discussion around the use of different
functions and variables that are
dependent, independent or
interdependent.
AO3.3: Evaluation
Candidates will need to consider a variety
of viewpoints in relation to following
standard rules for functions and variables
while developing management software
and will make evaluative comments about
the issues and solutions they are
discussing e.g.
Why using functions longer than one
page of code will increase complexity?
Why hardware-specific code must be
avoided?
Why variables must not be setup
outside the scope of a function?
How a single entry point reduces
complexity and makes the search for
any bugs more straightforward?
What will happen if embedded
documentation is not adequate?
