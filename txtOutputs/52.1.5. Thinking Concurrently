Benefits and Drawbacks of Concurrent Processing  
 
Benefits of concurrent processing  
● The ​number of tasks completed in a given time ​ is increased. 
●Less time is wasted waiting ​ for an input or user interaction, as 8other tasks can be 
completed. 
 
Drawbacks of concurrent processing 
● Concurrent processing can take longer to complete when large numbers of users or 
tasks are involved as processes cannot be completed at once. 
● There is an​ overhead in coordinating ​ and switching between processes, which 
reduces program throughput. 
● Just as with parallel processing, not all tasks are suited to being broken up and 
performed concurrently.
