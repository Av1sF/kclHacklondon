Asymmetric Encryption 
 
●Two keys ​are used: public and private 
● The public key can be published ​anywhere 
● The private key must be kept secret 
● Together, the keys are known as a ​ key pair 
● The keys​ ​are ​mathematically related ​to one another 
● Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the 
corresponding private key 
● Encrypting a message using your private key ​ verifies that the message was sent by 
you​. If your public key can decrypt a message, then it ​must​ have been encrypted 
with your private key, which ​only you ​have access to. 
 
Hashing 
 
● An input (called a key) is turned into a fixed size value (called a hash) 
● A vast number of algorithms, called ​hash functions ​, do this 
● The output of a hash function ​ can’t be reversed ​ to form the key 
● the keys, which​ can’t be reversed ​to gain the passwords. 
● A hash table is a ​data structure​ which holds ​ key-value pairs 
● Hash tables can be used to ​ lookup data ​ in an array in ​ constant time 
● Hash tables are used extensively in situations where a lot of data needs to be 
stored with ​constant access times​. For example, in ​caches ​and ​databases 
● If two keys produce the same hash, a ​collision ​is said to occur 
● Methods to overcome collisions include ​storing items together in a list ​ under the 
hash value and ​using a second hash function ​ to generate a new hash 
● A​ good hash function ​ should have a ​ low chance of collision ​and should be ​ quick to 
calculate 
● A hash function’s output should be ​ smaller than the input ​it was provided
