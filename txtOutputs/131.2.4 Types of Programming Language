Examiner's Comments
The specification clearly outlines the LMC
mnemonics which are acceptable in
learners' responses. Some candidates
used LMC mnemonics correctly, gaining
some credit. Other candidates answered
using procedural pseudocode gaining no
credit. Centres are advised to ensure
candidates have the range of LMC
mnemonics at their disposal prior to sitting
the examination.

(designated) label / another point in the

Examiner's Comments
Many candidates failed to gain credit on
this question due to the lack of attention to
detail in their response, which is essential
at this level of study. Some candidates
responded with answers such as: ‘the code
branches if the result is positive’. Many
candidates did not demonstrate
understanding that it is the value in the
accumulator which is being tested for
whether it is positive or not.
