 
There are two factors which determine the page rank of a page:  
- How many ​incoming links ​ it has from other web pages 
- The ​page rank ​ of the web pages that ​link to it 
 
The data structure used to display this information is a 
directed graph. This shows which pages link to other 
websites, and webpages are represented as nodes while 
links between two pages are represented as arcs between 
the nodes. 
 
The pagerank algorithm is as follows: 
 
PageRank(x) = (1-d) + d[(PageRank(T1) ÷ Count(T1)) + … + (PageRank(Tn) ÷ Count(Tn)]  
 
where ​PageRank(x)​ is the page rank of page ​x ​, ​Count(Tn) ​ is the total count of outbound 
links from a webpage ​n ​and ​d ​is the damping factor. This is usually set to 0.85. 
 
 
Server and Client Side Processing 
 
Server side Processing 
Server side processing is when a ​client sends data to a server ​ for it to be processed. This 
means no information is processed on the client computer. Common server side scripting  
languages are ​SQL​ or ​PHP​. Server side processing is useful for several reasons:  
● Does not require ​plugins   
● Can perform ​large calculations ​ much faster than clients 
● Not browser dependent, 
● More ​secure 
 
Client side Processing  
Client side processing is when a client processes the data on a ​local device ​. This means 
that all of the information is processed on the client computer. This is also called client side  
scripting, and uses languages such as ​JavaScript​. This is useful for the following reasons: 
● Webpage can immediately respond to user actions 
● Executes quickly 
● Gives developers more control over the behaviour and look of the website
