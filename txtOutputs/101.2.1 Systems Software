4 – Complete the current FDE Cycle
– Check the priority of the incoming
interrupt.
– If its of a higher priority than the current
task.
– Contents of registers stored in
memory..
– … in a stack.
– The relevant interrupt service routine is
loaded …
– ..by loading the relevant value into the
program counter.
– When the ISR is complete the previous
state is popped from the stack
– And are loaded back into the registers.
