>> 
Stack.append(“Elijah”)  
>> Adds a new value to the end  
of the list. Needs to check  
that the stack is not full

peek()  Stack.peek()  
>> “Elijah”  Returns the top value from  
the stack. First checks the  
stack is not empty by  
looking at value of top  
pointer.  
pop()  Stack.pop()  
>> “Elijah”  Removes and returns the  
top value of the stack. First  
checks the stack is not  
empty by looking at value of  
top pointer.  
size()  Stack.size()  
>> 2 Returns the size of the stack   
isFull()  Stack.isFull()  
>> False  Checks if the stack if full  
and returns a Boolean
