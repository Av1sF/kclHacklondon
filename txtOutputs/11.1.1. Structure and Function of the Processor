Harvard architecture has physically separate memories for instructions and data, more  
commonly used with embedded processors.This is useful for when memories have  
different characteristics ​, i.e. instructions may be read only, while data may be read-write.  
This also allows you to optimise the size of individual memory cells and their buses  
depending on your needs, i.e. the instruction memory can be designed to be larger so a  
larger word size can be used for instructions.  
 
Advantages of Von Neumann  
Architecture   Advantages of Harvard Architecture   
Cheaper to develop ​ as the control unit is  
easier to design  Quicker execution ​ as data and instructions  
can be fetched in parallel.   
Programs can be ​optimised in size  Memories can be different sizes ​, which can  
make more efficient use of space  
 
Contemporary Processing  
Contemporary processors use a ​combination of Harvard and Von Neumann ​ architecture. 
Von Neumann is used when working with data and instructions in main memory, but uses  
Harvard architecture to divide the cache into instruction cache and data cache.
