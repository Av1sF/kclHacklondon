Decision making in problem solving  
 
● A ​decision ​is a​ result reached after some consideration ​.  
● When solving problems and designing programs, many decisions have to be made. 
● Examples include choosing the programming ​paradigm ​used and deciding how 
different information is collected from the user 
● To simplify the decision making process, we ​limit the solutions ​ we can pick from.  
● When deciding on a programming language, you should consider what is suited to 
the task and your understanding of the language. 
● Identifying where decisions need to be made early allows us to gather enough 
information about our options.  
● In​ flow charts​, a decision is shown by a diamond shaped icon. It can have two 
results, yes or no (​true/false​). 
 
 
Conditions that affect the outcome of a decision 
 
● When making a decision, there are certain factors which determine the outcome 
you choose.  
○ What is most effective? 
○ What is most convenient? 
○ Is this option reasonable? 
● To make an appropriate decision, you need to ​evaluate these conditions ​. 
● It is also helpful to order them from most important to least important.  
● This makes it clearer how best to achieve your solution.  
 
 
Decisions affecting the flow of a program 
 
● Decisions are made to determine how different 
parts of the program are completed.  
● Say we are tasked with designing a simple 
runner game. We could design the game to be 
endless, or level-based. 
● These decisions produce different routes 
through the program.  
● It is also important to identify where decisions 
need to be made within the program, and plan 
out the outcomes of the decision made.  
● Again, the program follows a different route 
depending on the decision made by the user.
