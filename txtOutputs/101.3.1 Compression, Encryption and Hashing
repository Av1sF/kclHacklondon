1 When the file is compressed some
detail / data / quality / resolution is
lost…
… which is not noticeable in the video
file / video still viewable with lower
quality
… but would make the text file
unreadable / lose meaning or
comprehension3 The first bullet is for the idea that
something is lost in the compression
process.
The second bullet is for the idea that the
video file is still usable with this loss.
The third bullet is for the idea that the text
file is not usable.

2 i Lossless compression
The code has to be exactly as it was
originally written
… or else it will not work.3 Explanation must follow from the type of
compression given.
?Examiner's Comments ??
Middle ability candidates were largely able
to show their understanding of lossless and
lossy compression by identifying which
was to be used in the scenarios given, and
stronger candidates were able to also
justify why. It was pleasing to see
significantly better performance on this
topic than in previous sessions, suggesting
that centres have heeded to the advice
given in previous reports.
ii Lossy compression
Achieves higher compression / smaller
file size / faster streaming than lossless
Video can still be viewed at lower
quality (from the data compressed).3 ?Examiner's Comments
??
When candidates were justifying the use of
lossy compression for the large video,
most stated the fact that the loss of detail
was relatively inconsequential but only the
most able candidates went on to add that
in addition it provides better compression
ratios than lossless to give a full
justification.

3 Lossy means the decompressed file is not
identical to the original…
…the difference is unlikely to be noticed by
humans
Lossy will decrease the file size …
… so it can be sent via e-mail2 1 mark for each bullet.
(1 mark for identification of the effect, one
mark for an explanation)
