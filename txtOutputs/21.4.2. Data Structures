Post-order Traversal 
Post order traversal follows the order: left subtree, right subtree, root node.   
Using the outline method, nodes are traversed in the order in which you pass them on the  
right.

Hash Tables 
A hash table is an array which is coupled with a ​hash 
function.​ The hash function takes in data ( ​a key​) and 
releases an output ( ​the hash​). The role of the hash function 
is to ​map the key to an index ​ in the hash table.  
 
Each piece of data is mapped to a unique value using the 
hash function. However, it is sometimes possible for two 
inputs to result in the same hashed value. This is known as a 
collision ​. A ​good hashing algorithm ​ should have a ​low 
probability of collisions ​ occurring but in the event that it does occur, the item is typically  
placed in the next available location. This is called collision resolution.  
 
Hash tables are normally used for ​indexing ​, as they provide fast access to data due to 
keys having a unique, one-to-one relationship with the address at which they are stored..
