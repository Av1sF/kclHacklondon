Other uses of virtual machines include: 
- Protection from malware 
Malware will affect the virtual machine rather than the device being used.  
- Running incompatible software 
Programs specific to different operating systems or different versions of an  
operating system can be run within a VM, saving time and money required  
to purchase the hardware. 
A common example is of games consoles being implemented on PCs via a
virtual machine.
