Device Drivers 
 
Device drivers are computer programs which are provided 
by the operating system and allow the operating system to 
interact with hardware ​.  
 
When a piece of hardware is used, the device driver 
communicates this request to the operating system ​ which 
can then produce the relevant output. 
 
Device drivers are ​specific to the computer’s architecture ​, so 
different drivers must be used for different device types such 
as smartphones, games consoles and desktop PCs. Device 
drivers are also ​specific to the operating system ​ installed on the device.  
 
 
Virtual Machines 
 
A virtual machine is a ​theoretical computer ​ in that it is 
a​software implementation of a computer system ​. It provides 
an ​environment with a translator ​ for intermediate code to 
run. 
 
Intermediate Code 
Code that is ​halfway between machine code and object code ​is called intermediate code. 
This is​ independent of the processor architecture ​ so can be runacross different machines 
and operating systems.  
 
Virtual machines are commonly used to ​test programs on different operating systems ​, 
saving the time and money of purchasing multiple devices for testing. However, running  
intermediate code in a virtual machine can be ​considerably slower.  
 
Other uses of virtual machines include: 
- Protection from malware 
Malware will affect the virtual machine rather than the device being used.  
- Running incompatible software 
Programs specific to different operating systems or different versions of an  
operating system can be run within a VM, saving time and money required  
to purchase the hardware.
