 
Assembly Language 
 
● Low level language that is the ​next level up from machine code  
●Uses mnemonics ​, which are ​abbreviations for machine code instructions  
● Commands used are ​processor-specific  
● Each line in assembly language is equivalent to one line of machine code 
 
Below is a list of the mnemonics you need to be aware of and be able to use:  
 
Mnemonic  Instruction  Function  
ADD  Add Add the value at the given memory address to the  
value in the Accumulator  
SUB  Subtract  Subtract the value at the given memory address  
from the value in the Accumulator  
STA  Store  Store the value in the Accumulator at the given  
memory address  
LDA  Load  Load the value at the given memory address into the  
Accumulator  
INP  Input  Allows the user to input a value which will be held in  
the Accumulator  
OUT  Output  Prints the value currently held in the Accumulator  
HLT  Halt Stops the program at that line, preventing the rest of  
the code from executing.  
DAT  Data  Creates a flag with a label at which data is stored.  
BRZ  Branch if zero  Branches to a given address if the value in the  
Accumulator is zero. This is a conditional branch.  
BRP  Branch if positive  Branches to a given address if the value in the  
Accumulator is positive. This is a conditional branch.  
BRA  Branch always  Branches to a given address no matter the value in  
the Accumulator. This is an unconditional branch.
