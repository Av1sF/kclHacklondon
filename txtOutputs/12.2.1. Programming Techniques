 
Use of object-oriented techniques 
 
The techniques used in object-oriented programming are fundamental throughout all of  
computer science.  
 
Object-oriented languages are built around the idea of classes. A ​class ​is a ​template for an 
object ​and defines the ​state and behaviour of an object ​. State is given by ​attributes ​which 
give an ​ object’s properties ​. Behaviour is defined by the ​methods ​associated with a class, 
which describe the ​actions it can perform ​. 
 
Classes can be used to create objects by a process called ​instantiation ​. An ​object ​is a 
particular instance of a class ​, and a class can be used to create multiple objects with the 
same set of attributes and methods.  
 
In object-oriented programming, ​attributes are declared as private so can only be altered 
by public methods ​. This is called ​encapsulation ​. Encapsulation is a technique used 
throughout programming to implement the principle of ​information hiding ​. This is when 
programs are made ​less complex ​by ​protecting data from being accidentally edited ​ by 
other parts of the program. Top-down design implements the same principle of  
encapsulation, as each module is designed to be self-contained.
