Hash Tables 
A hash table is an array which is coupled with a ​hash function. ​ The hash function takes in 
data (​a key​) to produce a unique output ( ​the hash​). It exists to ​map the key to a unique 
index ​ in the hash table.  
 
Sometimes, two keys might produce the same hashed value. 
This is called a ​collision ​, in which case the item is typically 
placed in the next available location. A ​good hashing 
algorithm ​ should have a ​low rate of collisions ​.  
 
Hash tables are commonly used for ​indexing ​, as they provide 
fast access to data due to keys having a unique, one-to-one 
relationship with the address at which they are stored.
