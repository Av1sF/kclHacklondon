b
 One byte correct (1) all three bytes
correct. (1)2 Allow FT if (a) is incorrect but bottom row
must match XOR with top row and key. 
c Symmetric (1) …. as the same key is used
to decrypt it as encrypt it (1) 2 Allow FT for asymmetric if (b) indicates
asymmetric encryption used 
d Any four from:
Symmetric encryption would require both
parties to have copy of the key (1) this
couldn’t be transmitted over the internet or
an eavesdropper monitoring the message
may see it (1) Asymmetric gets round this
requirement as there are two different keys
(1) One key encrypts the data (1) which
can be publically distributed (1) and a
different key to decrypt it (1) which is kept
private (1)4
