 
● Problem ​decomposition ​ is used to identify where previously-developed ​program 
components ​ can be ​reused. 
● Reusable components are ​more reliable ​ than newly-coded components, as they 
have ​already been tested ​.  
● They ​save time, money and resources ​.  
● Components ​may need to be modified to be compatible ​with existing software. 
● This can be more costly and time-consuming than developing them from scratch.

Caching 
●Storing instructions or values in cache memory ​ after they have been used, as they  
may be used again ​.  
●Saves time​ of retrieving instructions from secondary storage again. 
Frequently-accessed web pages ​ are cached so content can be ​ quickly loaded  
● This​ frees up bandwidth ​ for other tasks on a network. 
●Prefetching ​ is when ​algorithms predict which instructions are likely to soon be 
fetched​ and are ​loaded and stored in cache ​.  
● Thinking ahead means ​less time is spent waiting ​for instructions to be fetched. 
● Limited by ​accuracy of algorithms used ​, as data stored in cache is not always used. 
● Effectiveness depends on caching algorithm’s ability to manage the cache: 
● Larger caches take a long time to search, but smaller ​cache sizes limit how much 
data can be stored ​.  
● Can be ​difficult to implement ​ well.
