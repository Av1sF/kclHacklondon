 
Reusable components are ​more reliable ​ than newly-coded components, as they have 
already been tested ​ and any bugs dealt with. This ​saves time, money and resources ​. 
Subroutines can then simply be reused with different arguments to produce a variety of  
outputs. Producing well-tested, reusable components means that they can also be ​reused 
in future projects ​,​ saving development costs ​. However, it may not always be possible to 
integrate existing components developed by third parties due to ​compatibility issues ​ with 
the rest of the software. This may mean these components need to be modified to work  
with existing software, which can sometimes be more costly and time-consuming than  
developing them in-house.
