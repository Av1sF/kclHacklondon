 
Loaders 
Loaders are programs provided by the operating system. When a file is executed, the  
l​oader retrieves the library or subroutine from the given memory location ​. 
 
Use of Libraries 
Libraries are ​pre-compiled programs ​which can be incorporated within other programs 
using either static or dynamic linking. They are ​ready-to-use and error free ​, so ​save time 
developing and testing modules. Another advantage of libraries is that they ​can be reused  
within multiple programs. 
 
Libraries are often used to provide a specialised range of functions which would otherwise  
require a lot of time and effort to develop, so ​ save programmers from having to ‘reinvent 
the wheel’ ​ and instead make use of others’ expertise. Popular libraries provide  
mathematical and graphical functions.
