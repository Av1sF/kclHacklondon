D  0​A  11​C  8​A  14​B  23​D 
We now know that the shortest possible path between the nodes A and E has a weight  
of 23. In order to find the path that we took, we make use of the subscript letters.  
 
Start from the finishing node, E. The value of 23 at E is marked as from D. The final  
value in D’s column is 14 from B. Looking at B’s column, we see that it is 11 from C.  
Finally, C is marked as 8 from A.  
 
 
This process, which the diagram above represents, results in the nodes E, D, B, C, A.  
Reverse this order to get the shortest path through the network.  
 
The shortest path through the network from A to E is  
A, C, B, D, E and has a weight of 23 minutes.
