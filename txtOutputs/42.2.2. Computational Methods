 
Pipelining 
Pipelining ​ is a process that allows for projects to be delivered faster, as modules are  
divided into individual tasks, with ​different tasks being developed in parallel ​. Traditionally, 
the ​output of one process in pipelining becomes the input of another ​, resembling a 
production line ​. Pipelining is commonly used in ​RISC processors ​, in which the different 
sections of the​ Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle ​ are performed simultaneously.  
 
Visualisation 
Data can be ​ presented in a way that is easier for us to understand ​using ​visualisation ​ to 
produce graphs, trees, charts etc. This makes it possible to ​identify trends that were not 
otherwise obvious ​. Visualisation is another technique that is used by businesses to identify  
patterns which can be used to inform business decisions.
