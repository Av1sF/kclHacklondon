Lexical analysis is necessary to put the
code into a format which can be read and
processed (i.e. parsed) by the syntax
analyser.
Syntax Analysis is necessary to ensure the
code is valid in as much as it meets all the
structural rules of the language. This
guarantees it will run (though it might not
do as expected and may still have
occurrences of runtime errors).
Code generation is necessary to turn the
code into a format that the processor can
understand (i.e. binary machine code).
The code optimisation whilst not
necessary, does ensure the code runs
quicker or using less memory.
Linking is necessary to ensure the library
code is incorporated into the final program.
Examinerâ€™s Comments
Candidates were assessed on the quality
of their extended response in this question.
Many candidates explained the stages of
compilation very well. Some went on to
describe how code from the library
becomes part of the finished program
equally well. Few justified why each stage
was necessary. Many candidates scored
well on this question.
